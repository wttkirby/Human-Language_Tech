 2 stars for concept. 2 stars for execution. 2 stars for Floyd, 2 stars for introducing me to bungheaded twizzle, and.... Another star because of the commitment one guy had to twitching around in a hot tub for a solid two minutes while wearing a horse head.
 I wanted to give a star for every time Dan changed shirts, but I can only give 10. Boo.
 This movie demands to be seen on a double bill with Barn of the Blood Llama. Drugs help.
 This is amazing. Get out of here with your "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" or "Velocipastor". This is the low budget Indy movie of the millennium. I'm only taking away one point for making the always adorable llama a bad guy. But, since this one was from space, all is forgiven.
 This film is greater than Citizen Kane. No lie. We did a drinking game taking a shot everytime Dan changed shirts and I woke up dead. A masterpiece.
 This film is absolutely ridiculous and we enjoyed it thoroughly. If you're looking for a low budget comedic horror flick that is thoroughly aware of its own preposterousness, you've found it here. Great job to the cast and crew for not taking yourselves too seriously. We even laughed through the end credits, which featured a great rap recap of the film and a bonus scene afterwards. We will never look at a llama the same way again.
 Yeah it's only about an hour long but if love cheesy flix this is a must see. Bad acting? Check. Cheesy effects? You got it!!!! The thing is it moves along pretty well. There are parts of it you gotta wonder how they got through it without laughing constantly. The premise alone is so out there it makes you wonder. A killer llama from space? Sure!!!! Why not!!!! It's a fun ride that ya gotta see to believe. If I could get my hands on a hard copy I'd own it!!!!
 Although I had low expectations for this film, I couldn't resist the title. At the first sight of the red glaring eyes of the Space Llama, I was already beginning to giggle. Since a teenage brother and sister are house watching, the sister naturally texted virtually everyone in her school to come to their house party. When one of the girls is driving to her house, she is laser beamed to death by the Space Llama. The last text from her to the house sitting sister reads "AHHHHHHH!!!" What could have been heavy handed gore, became a laugh riot of hapless teens being repetitively sprayed with super-soaker fake blood and/or green Llama goo. Meanwhile, Dan relishes his quick wardrobe (shirt) changes in multiple scenes. In fact, Dan eventually ends up swinging a "Space Bat" (i.e. An aluminum foil wrapped baseball bat), while wearing Captain Kirk's Starfleet tunic from Star Trek the Original Series! In addition to being a scifi/horror parody, it tosses in takes on exploitation Kung-Fu flicks of the 70's. How can you not love the Space Llama POV scenes of it pummeling some hapless victims with slapping fisticuffs sound effects from Kung-Fu flicks? As Joe Bob Briggs might have said: It's got Space Alien Goo Fu, Hot Tub Electrocution Fu, Super Soaker Blood Fu , and Kung Fu Fu...check it out. BTW, I have died and have gone to Laugh Track Heaven.
 This movie was life changing, such an artistic take on our dystopian society. Was totally snubbed at this years Oscar's, the soundtrack was a musical masterpiece. And the CGI was so extremely well done I felt like the llama was going to get me with his laser beam eyes. This movie compliments your average Wednesday night acid trip.
 The following tale of alien encounters is true. And by "true", I mean "false". It's all lies. But they're entertaining lies. And in the end, isn't that the real truth? The answer is: No. Truth or not, this film has no right to be anywhere as much fun as it is. Did it stretch the limits of what can be achieved with a small budget? No. But was it sort of fantastic in a way I can't put my finger on? Yes.
 I second that the cgi was the best I've ever seen. You're rooting for Louie the llama the whole way through, whilst wanting to look through Dan's wardrobe!
 Absolute masterpiece. The llama was terrifying! Best 70 minutes of my life to date.
 Not even on Llama Planet could this be considered a good movie. It's bad on every level. BUT there is just something so honest and funny and great about it. Clearly, at no point did anyone take themselves serious, and they had so much fun doing it. I've watched my fair share of terrible movies and Asylum Films, and they didn't have this enjoyment to them. I seriously chuckled every time I saw the llama's glowing red eyes. Or whenever Dan had on a different shirt. As a clear parody of the crappy film genre, this is great. Everything you might see in a terrible made-for-cable movie is right here, but with just enough tongue-in-cheek self-awareness to make it humorous. Great drinking game movie, actually. Red-eyed llama? Take a drink. Dan in a different shirt? Take a drink. Close-up of a mouth? Do a shot.
 I actually really liked this movie. I'm always skeptical of movies being bad on purpose, but this one was pretty fun, and I had a few genuine laughs. Dan's shirts - 5 stars Llama - 5 stars GWAR-esque blood spray - 5 stars.
 There is no way to describe this masterpiece. You don't just watch it.... you experience it. I'll never view Llamas the same again.
 With a title like "Llamageddon", you obviously are not expecting an installment of "Masterpiece Theater"! It is, pretty much, what you'd expect--a film with production values similar to "Birdemic" and a lot of other zero budget movies. The film begins with a cheap cartoon sequence showing celestial llamas hopping about spaceships that look like horse trailers with wings...and they blast into space. One lands on Earth and the film becomes live action....with a llama wandering about with glowy red eyes. You never actually SEE the llama do anything but it supposedly kills with abandon. Fortunately, its main victims are a house party full of young people who are complete losers. So, while the film is very bad, at least you get to see a bunch of jerks die...which Is why I give this one a 2 and not a 1. Plus, it fortunately never took itself seriously. However, don't expect cleverness or humor...it's a pretty limp viewing experience....one I'd just as soon not repeat. By the way, if you do watch this one, just be forewarned...it's very crude and crass and is probably not a film to show your kids, mother or Father O'Malley.
 Scariest movie in years. The acting was all Oscar worthy performances. Amazing special effects. The Lhama though. Move over Michael Myers!  ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 After watching this theatrical masterpiece it has kept me up these past couple nights thinking about just how much of an impact this has had on me. I look into the mirror and I do not see myself anymore. Life as I know it has been altered in ways I cannot possibly describe in a few short words. This movie should be preserved for generations to come because it shows humanity how to come together in the face of insurmountable odds. If a few drunk college kids can overcome an evil space llama with laser eyes; us as a human race together can accomplish anything we set our minds to. And the world will be a better place for it.
 Louie the llama puts up a performance deserving of best actor forever. If you have ever seen The Shawshank Redemption this makes that look like it deserves one star. Every actor in this puts up a performance for the ages. This is the greatest film of all time and will never be beaten.
 "Alpaca bowl and watch this movie over and over again. "-MZ If you don't watch this movie, you're missing out on a life experience. It has everything you could ever wish for.
 Until today my favourite film was jaws but forget Brody and quint Llamageddon Is an absolute masterpiece. Some of the acting is 2nd to none and couple that with brilliant writing we have something very special Warning do not watch sobur.
 This film is a comedy masterpiece. So funny reading all the one star reviews. Everything terrible in this movie is done brilliantly to perfection.
 Know that you're about to witness something that is to film what tori spelling is to acting. It's purposefully terrible and does not disappoint in that aspect. Everything is tacky. Everyone is terrible. It's perfect.
 If you get a chance to watch this film, you will not be disappointed. From the amazing acting, with the obvious stifled smiles, to the random dog that turns up in a couple scenes. The sound is especially something to admire, the actors have to share a boom mic and it seems it isn't long enough to reach some of them and they sound like they're down a hole. The heroic father takes the award for the most ambitious attempt, obviously growing up watching the 80's action films. The Llama hand to hand combat is epic!!!! I want to give this film more stars, just because of the sheer attempt at what they were aiming for, and knowing they were intergalactically as far from it as they could have possibly been. Well done!
 I couldn't finish this film, I gave it maybe 20 minutes but it was unbearable. This is not "so bad it's good" like other reviewers are suggesting and giving this a 10 out of 10 (probably all fake reviews from the director). On the basis of those reviews I went into this thinking I would be perpetually amused or bemused a la Wiseau's The Room but I was not. This was unwatchable bad not funny bad.
