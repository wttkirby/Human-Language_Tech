# Human-Language_Tech
This is the git for my human language technologies class (CS 4395.001)

# Assignment 0: Overview of NLP
For this assignment I had to set up my github for the class and write a small [overview](Overview_of_NLP.pdf) of natural language processing.

# Assignment 1: Text Processing in Python
For this assignment I had to read in and process data from a .csv file in python. I had to make sure that everything was formatted correctly. To run it using the command prompt, navigate to the folder the file is in and type in **python Homework1_irk180000.py** followed by the location of the data. For me the full command looked like **python Homework1_irk180000.py Data\data.csv** but it may look different depending where you have the data located. I really liked processing text in python. It felt a lot easier than Java in my opinion, as the regex import made a lot of it easier. I had some difficulty figuring out how to iterate through the list so that I could make sure all the inputted data was correctly formatted but that was most likely due to my lack of experience in python, not by any fault of python itself. I was mostly overthinking it. I overall feel a lot more confident in python and my ability to figure out what I need to do to program in it. Overall, its an easy language to learn and it makes sense to me. This is the [program](https://github.com/wttkirby/Human-Language_Tech/blob/main/Assignment_1/Homework1_irk180000.py).

# Assignment 2: Word Guess Game
For this assignment I had to use NLTK to explore a text file and familiarize myself with the given tools. After using various tools imported from NLTK I made a simple word guessing [game](https://github.com/wttkirby/Human-Language_Tech/blob/main/Assignment_2/Homework2_IRK180000.py). To use the program it is similar to assignment one as you must go to the command prompt and write **python Homework2_IRK180000.py anat19.txt**, but should run normally after that point.
