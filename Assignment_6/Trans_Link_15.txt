What bills are you tracking?
We strive to present the most comprehensive and up-to-date data record of anti-trans legislation in the United States.
Trans Legislation Tracker also maintains an expanding archive of historical data regarding U.S. anti-trans bills.
What is happening with anti-trans legislation in 2023?
2023 marks the fourth consecutive record-breaking year for anti-trans legislation in the U.S.
In just one month, the U.S. doubled the number of anti-trans bills being considered across the country from the previous year.
We've seen familiar themes: attacks on gender-affirming care, education, athletics, birth certificates, religious discrimination, and other categories documented in our 2022 anti-trans legislation overview .
However, in 2023 we've seen an escalation on healthcare, as states like Kansas, Oklahoma, and South Carolina introduce bans on gender-affirming care that extend into adulthoodâ€”up to 26 years old.
In educational settings, bills like AZ HB1700 encourage parents to report and ban books which "promote gender fluidity or gender pronouns."
Others like AZ SB1001 require that both a guardian and teacher approve of a student's pronouns.
We've also seen the rise of "drag bans" targeting gender non-conforming performance.
Bills like AZ SB1026 use broad definitions like dressing "in clothing and makeup opposite of the performer's gender at birth" and using language like "drag show targeting minors" to insinuate harmful intent.
And the definitions are often broad enough to include libraries hosting story hours, musicals, or even an acting troupe performing Shakespeare .
National anti-trans legislation also surfaced in 2023.
The "Women's Bill of Rights" would erase trans recognition by the federal government, defining sex assigned at birth as an "immutable" definition of man or woman, boy or girl.
The "My Child, My Choice Act" would impose educational restrictions nationally that are similar to those we're tracking in states across the country.
