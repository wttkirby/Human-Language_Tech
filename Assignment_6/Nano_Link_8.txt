Although nanotechnology is a relatively recent development in scientific research, the development of its central concepts happened over a longer period of time.
The emergence of nanotechnology in the 1980s was caused by the convergence of experimental advances such as the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 and the discovery of fullerenes in 1985, with the elucidation and popularization of a conceptual framework for the goals of nanotechnology beginning with the 1986 publication of the book Engines of Creation .
The field was subject to growing public awareness and controversy in the early 2000s, with prominent debates about both its potential implications as well as the feasibility of the applications envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology , and with governments moving to promote and fund research into nanotechnology.
The early 2000s also saw the beginnings of commercial applications of nanotechnology , although these were limited to bulk applications of nanomaterials rather than the transformative applications envisioned by the field.
Early uses of nanomaterials The term "nanotechnology" (which paralleled Taniguchi's "nano-technology" ) was independently applied by Drexler in his 1986 book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology , which proposed the idea of a nanoscale "assembler" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity.
He also first published the term " grey goo " to describe what might happen if a hypothetical self-replicating machine , capable of independent operation, were constructed and released.
Drexler's vision of nanotechnology is often called " Molecular Nanotechnology " (MNT) or "molecular manufacturing."
His 1991 Ph.D. work at the MIT Media Lab was the first doctoral degree on the topic of molecular nanotechnology and (after some editing) his thesis, "Molecular Machinery and Manufacturing with Applications to Computation," In nanoelectronics , nanoscale thickness was demonstrated in the gate oxide and thin films used in transistors as early as the 1960s, but it was not until the late 1990s that MOSFETs (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors) with nanoscale gate length were demonstrated.
Nanotechnology and nanoscience got a boost in the early 1980s with two major developments: the birth of cluster science and the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM).
These developments led to the discovery of fullerenes in 1985 and the structural assignment of carbon nanotubes in 1991.
The development of FinFET in the 1990s aldo laid the foundations for modern nanoelectronic semiconductor device fabrication .
Invention of scanning probe microscopy Gerd Binnig (left) and Heinrich Rohrer (right) won the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics for their 1981 invention of the scanning tunneling microscope .
The scanning tunneling microscope , an instrument for imaging surfaces at the atomic level, was developed in 1981 by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory , for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986.
Harry Kroto (left) won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Richard Smalley (pictured below) and Robert Curl for their 1985 discovery of buckminsterfullerene , while Sumio Iijima (right) won the inaugural 2008 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience for his 1991 discovery of carbon nanotubes .
Fullerenes were discovered in 1985 by Harry Kroto , Richard Smalley , and Robert Curl , who together won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry .
Smalley's research in physical chemistry investigated formation of inorganic and semiconductor clusters using pulsed molecular beams and time of flight mass spectrometry .
As a consequence of this expertise, Curl introduced him to Kroto in order to investigate a question about the constituents of astronomical dust.
These are carbon rich grains expelled by old stars such as R Corona Borealis.
The result of this collaboration was the discovery of C 60 and the fullerenes as the third allotropic form of carbon.
Subsequent discoveries included the endohedral fullerenes , and the larger family of fullerenes the following year.
and Iijima at NEC of single-walled carbon nanotubes and methods to specifically produce them by adding transition-metal catalysts to the carbon in an arc discharge.
In the early 1990s Huffman and Kraetschmer, of the University of Arizona , discovered how to synthesize and purify large quantities of fullerenes.
This opened the door to their characterization and functionalization by hundreds of investigators in government and industrial laboratories.
Shortly after, rubidium doped C 60 was found to be a mid temperature (Tc = 32 K) superconductor.
At a meeting of the Materials Research Society in 1992, Dr. T. Ebbesen (NEC) described to a spellbound audience his discovery and characterization of carbon nanotubes.
This event sent those in attendance and others downwind of his presentation into their laboratories to reproduce and push those discoveries forward.
Using the same or similar tools as those used by Huffman and Kratschmer, hundreds of researchers further developed the field of nanotube-based nanotechnology.
Government and corporate support Its goals are to advance a world-class nanotechnology research and development (R&D) program, foster the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefit, develop and sustain educational resources, a skilled workforce, and the supporting infrastructure and tools to advance nanotechnology, and support responsible development of nanotechnology.
The initiative was spearheaded by Mihail Roco , who formally proposed the National Nanotechnology Initiative to the Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Clinton administration in 1999, and was a key architect in its development.
He is currently the Senior Advisor for Nanotechnology at the National Science Foundation , as well as the founding chair of the National Science and Technology Council subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering and Technology.
Main article: Prey (novel) Prey is a 2002 novel by Michael Crichton which features an artificial swarm of nanorobots which develop intelligence and threaten their human inventors.
The novel generated concern within the nanotechnology community that the novel could negatively affect public perception of nanotechnology by creating fear of a similar scenario in real life.
Smalley criticized Drexler's work on nanotechnology as naive, arguing that chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions are hard to control, and that a universal assembler is science fiction.
Smalley believed that such assemblers were not physically possible and introduced scientific objections to them.
His two principal technical objections, which he had termed the “fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem”, argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms.
He also believed that Drexler’s speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology.
Smalley first argued that "fat fingers" made MNT impossible.
He later argued that nanomachines would have to resemble chemical enzymes more than Drexler's assemblers and could only work in water.
He believed these would exclude the possibility of "molecular assemblers" that worked by precision picking and placing of individual atoms.
Also, Smalley argued that nearly all of modern chemistry involves reactions that take place in a solvent (usually water), because the small molecules of a solvent contribute many things, such as lowering binding energies for transition states.
Since nearly all known chemistry requires a solvent, Smalley felt that Drexler's proposal to use a high vacuum environment was not feasible.
Smalley also believed that Drexler's speculations about apocalyptic dangers of self-replicating machines that have been equated with "molecular assemblers" would threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology.
To address the debate between Drexler and Smalley regarding molecular assemblers Chemical & Engineering News published a point-counterpoint consisting of an exchange of letters that addressed the issues.
In fact, the word " Drexler " appears only once in the body of the report (in passing), and "molecular manufacturing" or " molecular nanotechnology " not at all.
The report covers various risks of nanoscale technologies, such as nanoparticle toxicology.
It also provides a useful overview of several nanoscale fields.
The report contains an annex (appendix) on grey goo , which cites a weaker variation of Richard Smalley 's contested argument against molecular manufacturing.
It concludes that there is no evidence that autonomous, self replicating nanomachines will be developed in the foreseeable future, and suggests that regulators should be more concerned with issues of nanoparticle toxicology.
