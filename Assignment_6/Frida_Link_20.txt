She painted using vibrant colors in a style that was influenced by indigenous cultures of Mexico as well as by European influences that include Realism, Symbolism, and Surrealism.
Many of her works are self-portraits that symbolically express her own pain and sexuality.
In 1929 Kahlo married the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.
They shared political views, and he encouraged her artistic endeavors.
Her "Blue" house in Coyoacan, Mexico City is a museum, donated by Diego Rivera upon his death in 1957.
