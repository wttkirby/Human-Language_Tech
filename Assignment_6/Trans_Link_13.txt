Winning over hearts and minds has always been crucial in winning the fight for equality for LGBTQ Americans, and the anti-transgender fear-mongering manifested by this wave of anti-transgender legislation is a stark reminder of how much work remains to be done in educating Americans about who transgender people are.
The Human Rights Campaign will continue to work with our state and national partners to vigorously oppose and defeat anti-equality legislation and to advance critically needed protections at the state and federal level for all LGBTQ people.
