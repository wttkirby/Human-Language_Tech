Yulin Du Yifan Lyu Weihong Tan Article 09 Mar 2023 A dielectric electrolyte composite with high lithium-ion conductivity for high-voltage solid-state lithium metal batteries The authors developed a highly conductive and dielectric composite solid-state electrolyte by coupling BaTiO 3 and Li 0.33 La 0.56 TiO 3– x nanowires with a side-by-side heterojunction structure in a polyvinylidene difluoride matrix, which simultaneously promotes the dissociation of lithium salts to produce more movable Li ions and efficiently transports the generated movable Li ions.
Peiran Shi Jiabin Ma Feiyu Kang Article 09 Mar 2023 Strong coupling between a photon and a hole spin in silicon Strong intrinsic spin–orbit interaction unlocks the potential of circuit quantum electrodynamics with hole spins in silicon, resulting in strong spin–photon coupling of 300 MHz.
Cécile X. Yu Simon Zihlmann Romain Maurand Article 06 Mar 2023 Anomalous thickness dependence of photoluminescence quantum yield in black phosphorous Thickness-dependent photoluminescence quantum yield measurements in black phosphorus reveal a free-carrier to excitonic transition, differing from the behaviour of conventional semiconductors.
Naoki Higashitarumizu Shiekh Zia Uddin Ali Javey Article 06 Mar 2023 Giant orbital magnetic moments and paramagnetic shift in artificial relativistic atoms and molecules Electrostatically defined quantum dots in graphene constitute a testbed to study atomic and molecular physics in the ultrarelativistic regime—when the particle speed is close to the speed of light.
Magnetic-field-dependent tunnelling spectroscopy experiments now reveal giant orbital magnetic moments and paramagnetic shifts in single and double quantum dots due to their relativistic nature.
Zhehao Ge Sergey Slizovskiy Jairo Velasco Jr Article 06 Mar 2023 Oligomer nanoparticle release from polylactic acid plastics catalysed by gut enzymes triggers acute inflammation A large-scale pharmacophore model supported by in vitro ligand-binding studies suggests polylactic acid oligomer toxicity in a mouse model is due to the inhibition of matrix metallopeptidase 12.
Mengjing Wang Qianqian Li Mingliang Fang Article 02 Mar 2023 Latest Reviews & Analysis Oligomer nanoparticle release from a biodegradable plastic triggers acute gut inflammation Biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) microplastics are shown to undergo enzymatic hydrolysis by lipases found in the human gut to generate PLA oligomers, which self-aggregate to form nanoplastic particles.
The oligomers and their nanoparticles bioaccumulated in multiple organs of a mouse model and caused acute intestinal inflammation.
Research Briefing 08 Mar 2023 Relativistic quantum phenomena in graphene quantum dots Wavefunctions in graphene artificial atoms reveal giant orbital magnetic moments.
Daniel Walkup Nikolai B. Zhitenev News & Views 06 Mar 2023 Multidrug nanomedicine Polymer-based nanomedicines have been engineered to ratiometrically deliver three different drugs to tumors, thereby bridging in vitro–in vivo correlation and producing synergistic therapeutic efficacy in multiple myeloma mouse models.
Alexandros Marios Sofias Twan Lammers News & Views 17 Feb 2023 Twisted light gets a splash of colour A technique that blends micro- and nanometre-scale printed elements has been used to sculpture white light into a spatial array of coloured twisted beams, demonstrating sophisticated photonic control even with common incoherent sources of light.
