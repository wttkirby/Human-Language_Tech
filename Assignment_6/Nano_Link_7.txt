The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology .
A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative , which defined nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers (nm).
This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold.
It is therefore common to see the plural form "nanotechnologies" as well as " nanoscale technologies" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size.
Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science , organic chemistry , molecular biology , semiconductor physics , energy storage , and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios .
These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.
Origins Main article: History of nanotechnology The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by renowned physicist Richard Feynman in his talk There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom , in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms.
Comparison of Nanomaterials Sizes The term "nano-technology" was first used by Norio Taniguchi in 1974, though it was not widely known.
Inspired by Feynman's concepts, K. Eric Drexler used the term "nanotechnology" in his 1986 book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology , which proposed the idea of a nanoscale "assembler" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control.
Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded The Foresight Institute (with which he is no longer affiliated) to help increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications.
The emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through convergence of Drexler's theoretical and public work, which developed and popularized a conceptual framework for nanotechnology, and high-visibility experimental advances that drew additional wide-scale attention to the prospects of atomic control of matter.
In the 1980s, two major breakthroughs sparked the growth of nanotechnology in the modern era.
First, the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 which provided unprecedented visualization of individual atoms and bonds, and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989.
The microscope's developers Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986.
C 60 was not initially described as nanotechnology; the term was used regarding subsequent work with related carbon nanotubes (sometimes called graphene tubes or Bucky tubes) which suggested potential applications for nanoscale electronics and devices.
The discovery of carbon nanotubes is largely attributed to Sumio Iijima of NEC in 1991, which center on atomically precise manipulation of matter and discuss existing and projected capabilities, goals, and applications.
Fundamental concepts Nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale.
This covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced.
In its original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up, using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete, high-performance products.
One nanometer (nm) is one billionth, or 10 −9 , of a meter.
By comparison, typical carbon-carbon bond lengths , or the spacing between these atoms in a molecule , are in the range 0.12–0.15 nm , and a DNA double-helix has a diameter around 2 nm.
On the other hand, the smallest cellular life-forms, the bacteria of the genus Mycoplasma , are around 200 nm in length.
By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range 1 to 100 nm following the definition used by the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US.
The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which are approximately a quarter of a nm kinetic diameter ) since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules.
The upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size below which the phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device.
Areas of physics such as nanoelectronics , nanomechanics , nanophotonics and nanoionics have evolved during the last few decades to provide a basic scientific foundation of nanotechnology.
Larger to smaller: a materials perspective Image of reconstruction on a clean Gold ( 100 ) surface, as visualized using scanning tunneling microscopy .
The positions of the individual atoms composing the surface are visible.
Main article: Nanomaterials Several phenomena become pronounced as the size of the system decreases.
These include statistical mechanical effects, as well as quantum mechanical effects, for example the " quantum size effect" where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size.
This effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions.
However, quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached, typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called quantum realm .
Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.)
properties change when compared to macroscopic systems.
One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal and catalytic properties of materials.
Diffusion and reactions at nanoscale, nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics.
Mechanical properties of nanosystems are of interest in the nanomechanics research.
The catalytic activity of nanomaterials also opens potential risks in their interaction with biomaterials .
Materials reduced to the nanoscale can show different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macroscale, enabling unique applications.
For instance, opaque substances can become transparent (copper); stable materials can turn combustible (aluminium); insoluble materials may become soluble (gold).
A material such as gold, which is chemically inert at normal scales, can serve as a potent chemical catalyst at nanoscales.
Much of the fascination with nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale.
Simple to complex: a molecular perspective Main article: Molecular self-assembly Modern synthetic chemistry has reached the point where it is possible to prepare small molecules to almost any structure.
These methods are used today to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as pharmaceuticals or commercial polymers .
This ability raises the question of extending this kind of control to the next-larger level, seeking methods to assemble these single molecules into supramolecular assemblies consisting of many molecules arranged in a well defined manner.
These approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or supramolecular chemistry to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a bottom-up approach.
The concept of molecular recognition is especially important: molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to non-covalent intermolecular forces .
The Watson–Crick basepairing rules are a direct result of this, as is the specificity of an enzyme being targeted to a single substrate , or the specific folding of the protein itself.
Thus, two or more components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole.
Such bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel and be much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases.
Most useful structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms.
Nevertheless, there are many examples of self-assembly based on molecular recognition in biology , most notably Watson–Crick basepairing and enzyme-substrate interactions.
The challenge for nanotechnology is whether these principles can be used to engineer new constructs in addition to natural ones.
Molecular nanotechnology: a long-term view Main article: Molecular nanotechnology Molecular nanotechnology, sometimes called molecular manufacturing, describes engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) operating on the molecular scale.
Molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with the molecular assembler , a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of mechanosynthesis .
Manufacturing in the context of productive nanosystems is not related to, and should be clearly distinguished from, the conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles.
When the term "nanotechnology" was independently coined and popularized by Eric Drexler (who at the time was unaware of an earlier usage by Norio Taniguchi) it referred to a future manufacturing technology based on molecular machine systems.
The premise was that molecular-scale biological analogies of traditional machine components demonstrated molecular machines were possible: by the countless examples found in biology, it is known that sophisticated, stochastically optimized biological machines can be produced.
It is hoped that developments in nanotechnology will make possible their construction by some other means, perhaps using biomimetic principles.
However, Drexler and other researchers have proposed that advanced nanotechnology, although perhaps initially implemented by biomimetic means, ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles, namely, a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components (such as gears, bearings, motors, and structural members) that would enable programmable, positional assembly to atomic specification.
See nanotube nanomotor for more examples.
An experiment indicating that positional molecular assembly is possible was performed by Ho and Lee at Cornell University in 1999.
They used a scanning tunneling microscope to move an individual carbon monoxide molecule (CO) to an individual iron atom (Fe) sitting on a flat silver crystal, and chemically bound the CO to the Fe by applying a voltage.
Current research Graphical representation of a rotaxane , useful as a molecular switch .
This DNA tetrahedron Bottom-up approaches These seek to arrange smaller components into more complex assemblies.
DNA nanotechnology utilizes the specificity of Watson–Crick basepairing to construct well-defined structures out of DNA and other nucleic acids .
Approaches from the field of "classical" chemical synthesis (Inorganic and organic synthesis ) also aim at designing molecules with well-defined shape (e.g.
bis-peptides ).
More generally, molecular self-assembly seeks to use concepts of supramolecular chemistry, and molecular recognition in particular, to cause single-molecule components to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation.
Atomic force microscope tips can be used as a nanoscale "write head" to deposit a chemical upon a surface in a desired pattern in a process called dip pen nanolithography .
This technique fits into the larger subfield of nanolithography .
Molecular Beam Epitaxy allows for bottom up assemblies of materials, most notably semiconductor materials commonly used in chip and computing applications, stacks, gating, and nanowire lasers .
Top-down approaches These seek to create smaller devices by using larger ones to direct their assembly.
Many technologies that descended from conventional solid-state silicon methods for fabricating microprocessors are now capable of creating features smaller than 100 nm, falling under the definition of nanotechnology.
Giant magnetoresistance -based hard drives already on the market fit this description, as do atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques.
Peter Grünberg and Albert Fert received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2007 for their discovery of Giant magnetoresistance and contributions to the field of spintronics.
Productive nanosystems are "systems of nanosystems" which will be complex nanosystems that produce atomically precise parts for other nanosystems, not necessarily using novel nanoscale-emergent properties, but well-understood fundamentals of manufacturing.
Because of the discrete (i.e.
atomic) nature of matter and the possibility of exponential growth, this stage is seen as the basis of another industrial revolution.
Mihail Roco , one of the architects of the USA's National Nanotechnology Initiative, has proposed four states of nanotechnology that seem to parallel the technical progress of the Industrial Revolution, progressing from passive nanostructures to active nanodevices to complex nanomachines and ultimately to productive nanosystems.
Programmable matter seeks to design materials whose properties can be easily, reversibly and externally controlled though a fusion of information science and materials science .
Due to the popularity and media exposure of the term nanotechnology, the words picotechnology and femtotechnology have been coined in analogy to it, although these are only used rarely and informally.
Dimensionality in nanomaterials Nanomaterials can be classified in 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D nanomaterials .
The dimensionality play a major role in determining the characteristic of nanomaterials including physical , chemical and biological characteristics.
With the decrease in dimensionality, an increase in surface-to-volume ratio is observed.
This indicate that smaller dimensional nanomaterials have higher surface area compared to 3D nanomaterials.
Recently, two dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are extensively investigated for electronic , biomedical , drug delivery and biosensor applications.
Tools and techniques Typical AFM setup.
A microfabricated cantilever with a sharp tip is deflected by features on a sample surface, much like in a phonograph but on a much smaller scale.
A laser beam reflects off the backside of the cantilever into a set of photodetectors , allowing the deflection to be measured and assembled into an image of the surface.
There are several important modern developments.
The atomic force microscope (AFM) and the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology.
There are other types of scanning probe microscopy .
Although conceptually similar to the scanning confocal microscope developed by Marvin Minsky in 1961 and the scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) developed by Calvin Quate and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.
The tip of a scanning probe can also be used to manipulate nanostructures (a process called positional assembly).
Feature-oriented scanning methodology may be a promising way to implement these nanomanipulations in automatic mode.
In the absence of specific regulation forthcoming from governments, Paull and Lyons (2008) have called for an exclusion of engineered nanoparticles in food.
There is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology.
Some regulatory agencies currently cover some nanotechnology products and processes (to varying degrees) – by "bolting on" nanotechnology to existing regulations – there are clear gaps in these regimes.
Davies (2008) has proposed a regulatory road map describing steps to deal with these shortcomings.
Stakeholders concerned by the lack of a regulatory framework to assess and control risks associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have drawn parallels with bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" disease), thalidomide , genetically modified food, identified a risk of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released during disposal, destruction and recycling, and recommended that "manufacturers of products that fall under extended producer responsibility regimes such as end-of-life regulations publish procedures outlining how these materials will be managed to minimize possible human and environmental exposure" (p. xiii).
The Center for Nanotechnology in Society has found that people respond to nanotechnologies differently, depending on application – with participants in public deliberations more positive about nanotechnologies for energy than health applications – suggesting that any public calls for nano regulations may differ by technology sector.
