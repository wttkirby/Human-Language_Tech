It is located in the Colonia del Carmen neighborhood of Coyoacán in Mexico City .
The building was Kahlo's birthplace, the home where she grew up, lived with her husband Diego Rivera for a number of years, and where she later died in a room on the upper floor.
In 1957, Diego Rivera donated the home and its contents in order to turn it into a museum in Frida's honor.
The museum contains a collection of artwork by Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and other artists along with the couple's Mexican folk art , pre-Hispanic artifacts, photographs, memorabilia, personal items, and more.
The collection is displayed in the rooms of the house which remains much as it was in the 1950s.
It is the most popular museum in Coyoacán and one of the most visited in Mexico City.
The Blue House The house itself is located on the corner of Londres and Allende Streets, and it stands out for its cobalt-blue walls, giving it the name La Casa Azul (The Blue House).
The museum consists of ten rooms.
On the ground floor is a room that contains some of Kahlo's mostly minor works such as Frida y la cesárea , 1907–1954, Retrato de familia , 1934, Ruina , 1947, Retrato de Guillermo Kahlo , 1952, El marxismo dará salud , 1954 (showing Frida throwing away her crutches), with a watercolor Diario de Frida in the center.
One side of the courtyard contains the inscription "Frida y Diego / vivieron en / esta casa / 1929-1954" (Frida and Diego lived in this house – 1929–1954).
At that time and during the first half of the 20th century, Coyoacán was officially part of the Federal District of Mexico City, but was still relatively rural and separate from Mexico City's urban sprawl .
Since the late 19th century, a number of Mexico City's wealthy had built country homes in the area, often imitating the colonial designs of the past.
Colonia del Carmen became popular with artists and intellectuals starting around the 1920s, due to the promotion of it by Francisco Sosa and the establishment of the Escuela de Pintura al Aire Libre (Open Air School of Painting) at the former San Pedro Mártir Hacienda in 1923.
"(...) you should know, my little girl, that in the cell battery of my love there is enough energy (...), yet knowing that it was only five minutes ago that I found you and began to love you."
- Diego Rivera Frida Kahlo was born in this house in 1907, and it remained her family home throughout her life.
She spent her last thirteen years of it here as well.
Frida was the daughter of Wilhelm (Guillermo) Kahlo , who immigrated from Europe to Mexico and native Mexican Matilde Calderón y González.
Frida spent her childhood in this house.
She stated that during the Mexican Revolution , her mother would open the windows of this house in order to donate supplies to the Zapata army when it was in the area in 1913.
She also spent large amount of time in the house convalescing, first in 1918 when she was struck with polio which would leave one leg shorter than the other.
When she was 18, a trolley accident left her badly mangled.
She spent about two years confined to her bed in casts and orthopedic devices.
It was then she began to paint as a way to pass the time.
One of the works from this time has Frida on what appears to be a stretcher, her body bandaged and located to the side of this house.
