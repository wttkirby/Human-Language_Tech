The bill’s author, Rep. Barb Dittrich (R-Oconomowoc), seeks to prevent transgender athletes from participating in school athletics alongside their peers.
Representative Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) issued the following statement in response: “I am appalled by Republicans’ continued efforts to undermine the rights of LGBTQ+ Wisconsinites.
All students should have the right to participate in school sports in a way that is consistent with their gender identities.
This discriminatory bill will not become law, but its introduction alone sends a harmful message to young people in our state, perpetuating traumatizing and offensive stereotypes against trans youth.
“I want trans students in the 91st District to know that they are valid, that they belong in our classrooms and in all school sports and activities, and that they will always have my support.
I oppose this act of discrimination in the strongest possible way, and I will continue to fight for the rights of our LGBTQ+ community.” Emersonstatementantitranslegislation(002) Office of Representative Jodi Emerson State Capitol • PO Box 8952 • Madison, WI 53708 Phone: (608) 266-7461 • Toll-free: (888) 534-0091 Hi, I'm a custom footer section, please be careful with me.
