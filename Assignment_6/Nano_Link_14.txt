Pervasive global demand exists for a high performing, eco-friendly, long-lasting, and easy to use fireproofing solutions.
Current passive fire protection technologies, such as intumescent coatings, can be toxic, difficult to apply, and do not meet many of the needs in the field.
Additionally, the Nano Shield technology provides insulating effects to solve two unmet needs in a single technology.
The Technology As a Fireproofing Coating Nano Shield can be used as a coating to fireproof like no other coatings on the market: Fireproofing to 1,800° C at minimal thickness Spray on application and adheres to most surfaces with minimal surface prep Environmentally friendly with no reportable volatile organic compounds As an Insulative Coating Nano Shield can be used as an insulative coating: Just 5 mm of Nano Shield has the equivalent insulating properties of over 100 mm of insulating spray foam Additionally, the coating has a high emissivity and reflects away more than 94% of the heat The molecule can be adapted to provide both fireproofing and insulating in a single coating As an Additive The Nano Shield molecule can be added to existing building materials to provide both insulative and fireproofing characteristics: Paints, resins, gypsum, cement, polymers, plastics, fiberglass and much more can be embedded with the Nano Shield molecule with minimal loading Contact Us header porto-sicon-box Technology Applications Oil and Gas Use as a protective fireproofing coating for no smoke/toxicity and use composite materials to replace metallics.
Buildings and Construction Fireproof as a coating or embed the Nano Shield molecule into existing building materials Chemical Plants Fireproof and insulate your chemical plant.
Boiler skirts, infrastructure insulation, and much more Utilities Fireproof utility poles in fire prone areas as well as utility infrastructure Nano Shield Can Be Used As an Additive In drywall fiberglass paints resins polymers plastics to Fireproof and Insulate Nano Shield is not only a firepoofing and insulating coating, but also can be used as a powdered additive at minimal loading.
The molecule can be adapted to fit the media’s needs.
The media inherits the fireproofing and insulating properties with no coating required.

Fireproof to 1,800° C Time Independent Eco-Friendly Minimal Weight Adaptable Formula Spray On Application END REVOLUTION SLIDER The Science Behind Nano Shield Nano Shield uses the power of Nano technology to fireproof at temperatures that very few materials can achieve.
When exposed to an impingent flame or heat flux, the particles vibrate reflecting heat away.
The internal structure ensures low density and low mass which prevents heat penetration.
The molecule can be adapted to fit the temperature needs.
HIGH EMMISSIVITY The Nano Shield molecule reflects 94% of the heat that is introduced to it acting like a mirror header porto-sicon-box LOW THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY The thermal conductivity value (k-value) is 0.017 W/Mk, making it one of the lowest in the world header porto-sicon-box LOW DENSITY With a density of 0.39 to 0.45, both conductive and radiant heat transfers are not a problem for Nano Shield header porto-sicon-box LOW MASS The structural characteristics of the molecule allow for a light-weight material which dissipates heat header porto-sicon-box NanoTech has everything you need to fireproof and insulate!
